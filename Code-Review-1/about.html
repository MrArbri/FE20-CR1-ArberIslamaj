      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We help restaurants sell and increase their revenue. We do it by online
        ordering, supporting your restaurant’s brand, <br />our knowledge of the
        food service market, and our knowledge of the problems and needs of
        restaurant owners. <br />We are the market leader in online ordering
        directly from websites.
      </p>
      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        UpMenu is an online ordering system for restaurants that is available in
        a subscription model. <br />In a nutshell, our system allows a
        restaurant to start selling food online quickly and efficiently directly
        from the restaurant’s website. <br />We provide restaurants with a
        specialized online store. We are like Shopify but for restaurants.
        <br />UpMenu supports the restaurant’s brand and we build websites for
        restaurants which are essential tools for online marketing. <br />Our
        system offers several marketing tools like email campaigns, SMS,
        marketing automation, promotions, <br />and discount coupons that
        support the marketing activities of the restaurant.
      </p>
      <h2>What is important to us</h2>
      <p>
        The most important and valuable things for us in business and life are
        trust, understanding, and honesty. <br />They are the foundation on
        which we base and build our company, relationships with our customers,
        and with each other. <br />We treat our team and clients as partners.
        The success of each team member and each client is our success. <br />We
        are big fans of permanent personal development, but also balance in
        business and life. <br />We develop our company according to the spirit
        of Lean: in a versatile way through continuous learning and experience.
        <br />We get satisfaction from it.

      <h2>We’ve gone a long way</h2>
      <p>
        UpMenu was founded in February 2012, but our experience in the food
        service industry goes back much earlier. We worked with our first
        restaurants back in 2008 creating food ordering <br />
        websites for them. That was when our interest in the food service
        industry began. In 2012 we found a partner and investor with 20 years of
        experience with whom we have been developing <br />
        the company ever since.
