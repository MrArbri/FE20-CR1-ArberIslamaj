Project: Food blog

Technologies used:
• Frontend: HTML, CSS/SCSS

Overview
The Food blog project was my first and simplyest project. The tasks of this project were:
• Correct usage of the HTML structure. Make sure to use proper semantic elements and not only div elements. Use the right code indentation as well. 
• Use CSS selectors (classes and/or IDs) to style your web page. Make sure the classes have useful and proper names. Stick to the English language for it. 
• The contact-us link in the footer must be linked to https://codefactory.wien/en/contact-en/ 
• Use SASS/SCSS tools to style your website. 
• Correct usage of Flexbox and/or Grid (when necessary). The elements should be displayed according to the design given, respecting the columns and rows.
• Using positioning attributes, place the images with their respective overlays as in the example (hint: remember that for an absolute position child element, 
  the parent element must use position relative). Alternatively, you can use background-image attributes instead.
• Correct usage of Media Queries. For the mobile resolution of <= 480px, you should use the second guide template.
  Create a Media Query for tablets. For this option, as the tablet resolution is wider, two columns should be able to fit on the screen. 
  *Research what is the most popular tablet breaking point.
• Create a "recipe of the month" page and include the link in the top navbar. Fill this page with individual content. Be creative and choose a delicious recipe. 
• Create a webpage for the About link in the footer and provide your own design/layout solution for this additional page. 
  It must have a navbar, a middle section with the main content about the Food blog and a footer.
